    "In this lab, I will explore the task of image classification by building a model that can distinguish between images of dogs and cats. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the strengths of different modeling approaches, I will implement two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Vanilla CNN built from scratch to grasp the core mechanics of convolutional networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Fine-Tuned VGG16 model that applies transfer learning using pre-trained ImageNet weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, I aim to deepen my understanding of deep learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning. I will evaluate both models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to determine which approach performs best for this binary classification task."
